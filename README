DESCRIPTION

This module downgrades strings of text to match

  /^[-._A-Za-z0-9]*$/

or, to be more exact

  /^([A-Za-z0-9]([-._A-Za-z0-9]*[A-Za-z0-9])?$/

This makes the return values safe to be used as URL fragments
or as file names on many file systems where whitespace
and characters outside of the Latin alphabet are undesired
or problematic.
