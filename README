NAME
    Text::CleanFragment - clean up text to use as URL fragment or filename

SYNOPSIS
      my $title = "Do p\x{00FC}t <this> into URL's?";
      my $id = 42;
      my $url = join "/",
                  $id,
                  clean_fragment( $title );
      # 42/Do_put_this_into_URLs

    This module downgrades strings of text to match

      /^[-._A-Za-z0-9]*$/

    or, to be more exact

      /^([-.A-Za-z0-9]([-._A-Za-z0-9]*[-.A-Za-z0-9])?$/

    This makes the return values safe to be used as URL fragments or as file
    names on many file systems where whitespace and characters outside of
    the Latin alphabet are undesired or problematic.

FUNCTIONS
  `clean_fragment( @fragments )'
        my $url_title = join("_", clean_fragment("Ümloud vs. ß",'by',"Grégory"));
        # Umloud_vs._ss_by_Gregory

    Returns a cleaned up list of elements. The input elements are expected
    to be encoded as Unicode strings. Decode them using Encode if you read
    the fragments as file names from the filesystem.

    The operations performed are:

    *   Use Text::Unidecode to downgrade the text from Unicode to 7-bit
        ASCII.

    *   Eliminate single and double quotes, apostrophes.

    *   Replace all non-letters, non-digits by underscores, including
        whitespace and control characters.

    *   Squash dashes to a single dash

    *   Squash `_-_' and `_-_(-_)+' to -

    *   Eliminate leading underscores

    *   Eliminate trailing underscores

    *   Eliminate underscores before - or .

    In scalar context, returns the first element of the cleaned up list.
